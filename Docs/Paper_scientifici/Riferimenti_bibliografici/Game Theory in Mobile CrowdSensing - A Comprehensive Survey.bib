ABSTRACT = {Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) is an emerging paradigm in the distributed acquisition of smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) data. MCS requires large number of users to enable access to the built-in sensors in their mobile devices and share sensed data to ensure high value and high veracity of big sensed data. Improving user participation in MCS campaigns requires to boost users effectively, which is a key concern for the success of MCS platforms. As MCS builds on non-dedicated sensors, data trustworthiness cannot be guaranteed as every user attains an individual strategy to benefit from participation. At the same time, MCS platforms endeavor to acquire highly dependable crowd-sensed data at lower cost. This phenomenon introduces a game between users that form the participant pool, as well as between the participant pool and the MCS platform. Research on various game theoretic approaches aims to provide a stable solution to this problem. This article presents a comprehensive review of different game theoretic solutions that address the following issues in MCS such as sensing cost, quality of data, optimal price determination between data requesters and providers, and incentives. We propose a taxonomy of game theory-based solutions for MCS platforms in which problems are mainly formulated based on Stackelberg, Bayesian and Evolutionary games. We present the methods used by each game to reach an equilibrium where the solution for the problem ensures that every participant of the game is satisfied with their utility with no requirement of change in their strategies. The initial criterion to categorize the game theoretic solutions for MCS is based on co-operation and information available among participants whereas a participant could be either a requester or provider. Following a thorough qualitative comparison of the surveyed approaches, we provide insights concerning open areas and possible directions in this active field of research.},
